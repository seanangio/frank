  - description: Dear Valued Patients, 
  
  - description: First and foremost, thank you for choosing me to be your physical therapy provider. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with you.

  - description: At this time, I need to make you aware of some changes I plan to make in the structure and operation of my practice. I have reached a point in my life where my priorities have changed. I am 70 years old, and anxious to pursue several projects, both professional and personal, that have been “on the shelf” for several years.
  
  - description: Going forward; 

  - description: 1) As of June 1, 2022;

  - description: I will accept only traditional Medicare as a third party payer insurance. Patients covered under other insurance plans are welcome to utilize self-pay ($85 for initial evaluation, $65 per treatment session), and I can provide an itemized receipt for my services, which may be able to be submitted to your insurance company for reimbursement. Please understand that if you choose this option, I am willing to provide the receipt, but the burden of submitting this receipt to your insurance company will fall upon you.

  - description: 2) As of July 1,2022;
  
  - description: I will be starting a sabbatical of at least 6 months duration, effective July 1, 2022. What this means is that I will not be treating patients for 6 months. In order to facilitate an orderly continuation of care, I will stop accepting new patients as of April 25, 2022. I will attempt to continue accepting former patients for a new course of care as I am able, until my sabbatical begins on July 1, 2022.
  
  - description: Please understand that at present I plan to resume practicing sometime after January 1, 2023, i.e. I am not retiring. After 42 years of clinical practice, I just need a bit of a break.
  
  - description: Thank you again for your continued support. The work that I do as a Physical Therapist means the world to me, and this short break and restructuring of the practice will hopefully allow me to continue practicing for years to come.
  
  - description: Best wishes,
