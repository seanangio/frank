  - description: Dear Valued Patients, 
  
  - description: This is a quick note to let you know that I am planning to resume patient care early in January, 2023. I thoroughly enjoyed my sabbatical, including in several ways I never anticipated.

  - description: Going forward, the most significant change in my practice that may affect you is my decision to limit the insurances I accept to traditional Medicare only. All other patients, including those covered under Medicare Advantage Plans, will be required to pay for their Physical Therapy sessions (cash or check only, no plastic). My rate is $65 per session, and $85 for initial evaluation.
  
  - description: Please understand that this is a decision I have made only after a great deal of thought. Despite working with what I consider to be an efficient and knowledgeable billing agency, meeting insurance regulations in order for me to be paid were still requiring a far too significant amount of my time. 

  - description: Best wishes to you and your family for a Happy Holiday Season.

  - description: Sincerely,
